## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code over time. Using Git, multiple individuals can work on the same project simultaneously without conflict, by merging changes from different branches.

## Basic Git Commands

Below are some of the basic commands you will use frequently:

- `git clone`: Clone a repository into a new directory.
- `git status`: Show the working tree status.
- `git add`: Add file contents to the index.
- `git commit`: Record changes to the repository.
- `git push`: Update remote refs along with associated objects.
- `git pull`: Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch.

## How to Commit Changes

To commit your changes, follow these steps:

1. Make the desired changes in your codebase.
2. Use `git status` to check the changes.
3. Add the changes with `git add .`
4. Commit the changes with `git commit -m "Your message here"`

Your changes will now be committed to your local repository.

## How to Pull Updates

1. To get updates from the remote repository, use `git pull origin main`

This will fetch and merge any new updates into your local branch.

## How to Push Your Changes

After committing your changes, you want to push them so that others can see:

1. Use `git push origin main` to push your adjustments.

That's it! Now your changes are available for others to see and pull.

## Conclusion

This guide is meant to get you started with Git. Practice these commands and concepts to get comfortable with version control.

Good luck!
